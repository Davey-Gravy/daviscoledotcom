## So I'm Davis

This is admittedly, still a bit of a work in progress, but I find that this website is finally in a semi-presentable state!

Feel free to hang around, there might be something you find interesting here.

For a rambling overview of myself, feel free to dive into [my "autobiography"](about/) or my [Digital Den](https://notes.daviscole.com) (Obsidian notes vault), otherwise I'll provide the geostationary orbit-level view here:

I'm someone who tries to consider everything as interesting, since most things are interesting if you look deeply enough. This mindset has yielded me a rich set of hobbies ranging from sports, to photography, to [homelabbing](projects/homelab).

Academically, I am particularly drawn to continuum mechanics, more specifically as it relates to numerical simulation and CAE. I got OpenFOAM-pilled in my junior year of undergrad and can't go back. 

<!-- After having a great intern experience at DEKA R&D using OpenFOAM and other CAE tools, I had aspirations of becoming a therofluid analyst or aerodynamicist using the CFD and FEA simulation tools I had learned, ideally supporting the renewable energy industry. This idea brought me to Iceland to start a master's degree in sustainable energy engineering at Reykjavik University. While I had a valuable experience living on my own in a foreign country, the environment was not conducive to my mental health, and I dropped the program after doing well in my first semester.

My time on the Ansys Fluent testing team impressed the importance of IT in engineering; creating platforms for collaboration, writing internal tools, the rats nest of web development and cloud computing, and becoming a DevOps evangelist. I had intended to refine, expand, and apply my CFD knowledge at Ansys, however being only one of a few with just a bachelor's degree, my opportunities to do this work were limited. Instead, I started development on the team's Django-based internal testing portal and began administering Fluent's Windows regression test suite. While I was nominally a test engineer ("R&D Verification Engineer"...), I served the role of a DevOps or site reliability engineer, trying to keep the regression test orchestration workflow as stable as possible.

While I did not expect to do this kind of work upon joining, I leaned into it fully and soaked up material on Django and full stack development, CI/CD platforms, and the software development life cycle. I leaned in even further and started my homelabbing and self-hosting hobbies, which I've sunk far too much time and money into. -->

Reflecting upon my time in industry tells me that I currently do not have the credentials to work on the cool stuff, which is why my primary focus at the moment is enrolling in a graduate program, whether for a master's or a PhD. I spend so much time reading and listening to material about the bleeding edge, and not enough time applying myself to prove that I can work on it.

I created this blog to encourage myself to publish my work and show that I really am doing things, and that at the very least, I know [how to deploy a web application](posts/how-to-deploy-a-blog.md).
