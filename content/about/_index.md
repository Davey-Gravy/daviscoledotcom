I'm just another product of the sub-generation between Millennials and Gen Z; born too early to upload my consciousness to the Metaverse, born too late to gather shrooms for my tribe, but born just in time to be a top 0.001% carbon emitter and get my job stolen by AI.

My days are spent staring into black mirrors, whether for reading, writing, watching, or interacting. The emergence of remote work has accelerated the viability of this lifestyle. If I'm not tinkering within the space of computer hardware and software, then I am likely partaking in one (or more) of the following activities:

- Running
- Cycling
- Hiking
- Soccer
- Basketball
- Fishing
- Trumpet
- Guitar
- Photography
- many more

I strive to be a good time guy who surfs the vibe in search of ethical and sustainable dopamine and serotonin. Period.

## What makes me tick

I will attempt to describe my *modus operandi*, my driving philosophy, my reason to keep going.

I have always considered myself a *do-er*, someone who likes *doing* things. I like to evaluate myself and my progress by seeing what I am able to do now, as compared to the past. This can have different time scales; yesterday, last week, last month, last year, last decade.

I've had some talks with my brother about this in relation to work and our careers, and how I really put my nose to the grindstone professionally and personally. He has said to me verbatim, "You seem to value *doing* things more than me".
My immediate thought to this is, what is a human, if they are not doing? If one is not actively applying themselves to a particular task, then they may be in idle thought. I consider this doing. I love to sit in idle thought in slower moments of my life. I almost always complete these idle thought sessions with something of value, whether it was an internal understanding I have reached, newly found motivatino to do something, or, if I'm lucky, a good idea.

I have wondered if this is an ego thing of mine; that I am chasing satisfaction purely from making my mark on the world, regardless of the outcome of my meddling. I would like to think that I put a lot of thought into the things I care about, and that I should hold these positions strongly due to the thought and consideration put into the given topic.

I like to *do* because it doesn't limit me to a single area. While most of my daylight hours are spent working in software engineering, I take small breaks to practice music, whether on guitar, trumpet, or a computer. I work on my car, since the bills will pile up if I bring it to the shop for every minor maintenance job.

I've just spent a lot of time thinking about life. How will I stay financially stable? Where can I save money? How do I avoid burnout? How do I keep myself happy?

The things I do are coping mechanisms for my life.

## Eras

Not a Taylor Swift reference.

### My Beginning

I guess we can start from the top! I was born in Alice Peck Day Hospital in Lebanon, NH around 10am, to a Filipino mother and an American father. Please prepare yourself for an exposition dump; unfortunately context matters a lot in real-life.

<!-- #### My Dad

My father was born to Reuben Davis Cole and Marjorie Fletcher Cole in Lebanon, NH. He was a guy by all accounts. He studied hard, became a skilled golfer and skiier, and played alto saxophone in the band. He graduated as the valedictorian of his class, and enrolled in the computer science program at Dartmouth College. 

He quickly realized that:

1.  computer science is hard
2.  computer science at Dartmouth is *really* hard

This led him to switch into economics, which he had little issue with.

Upon graduation, he wasn't really sure what to do, so he enlisted as an officer in the US Navy. Of course, noticing his smarts, he was assigned to become an officer on a nuclear submarine, which required studies equivalent to a master's degree in nuclear engineering. Despite his prior academic success, he found himself at the bottom of his class, but still passed! 

After his 5-year stint and honorable discharge, he started working in the financial analysis and wealth management sector, at companies such as Gabelli & Co. and Hutchens Investment Management Inc., and eventually opening his own firm, New Leaf Asset Management. After his business partner, the President, CEO, Treasurer, etc., broke his fiduciary duty to one of his clients, the company was sued, leading to an internal audit that found that the same partner had been embezzling money to send his children to private school, lease a Cadillac Escalade, and for a membership at Lake Sunapee Country Club. This led to lawsuits involving my father, his business partner, and New Leaf, ultimately resulting in emotional and financial stress on my father, and the shuttering of New Leaf's doors.

After working for other companies for a few more years, my dad entered early retirement to take care of his septenarian parents, whose bodies were growing weak and minds becoming cloudy. After their passings in 2018 and 2021 respectively, my dad has been tending to our property ever since.

My grandparents are the closest things to real-life superheroes in my world. If you are curious about them at all, please consider reading their obituaries:

- [Marjorie Fletcher Cole](https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/vnews/name/marjorie-cole-obituary?id=9349791)

#### My Mom

My mother was born as the fourth of seven children in Pateros, Metro Manila, of the Philippines, a municipality known historically for their duck-raising industry and *balut* production. It is also one of the most densely-populated areas on Earth, with a population density of ~37,000 people per km<sup>2</sup>. Given these facts, it is safe to assume this is quite a poor area, which it is. In 2004, my family visited the Philippines, and upon seeing my mom's childhood home, my brother and I burst into tears at the sight, essentially being built of tin sheets and duct tape.

Due to this rampant poverty, Filipinos are often exploited as migrant workers due to the lack of opportunities, cheap wages, and their desire to send remittances to their families. Upon graduating from (college), my mom did this, working as a maid in Singapore and Saudi Arabia to support her family in Pateros. -->

### My Childhood

<!-- I hope the exposition dump will inform you better going forward. Apologies for subjecting you to that.

Now about myself. -->

I can't ever remember myself being bored with the world. The process of learning and collecting knowledge has always been a cherished activity. I attribute this to the wealth of almanacs, encyclopedias, dinosaur books, and fictional stories that my parents offered my brother and I growing up. We were also gently massaged (forced) to do math workbooks from a young age, so perhaps I am a product of Stockholm syndrome. Perhaps as a result, I've always been a technically-minded student, gravitating towards math and science for my academic interests.

While I will decide to make a career of building things in the future, my youth was often spent breaking things instead. A striking example to me comes from T-ball in Little League Baseball, when my galaxy brain thought that electrocuting my arm would juice it up and make me throw faster and further. So I naturally went down to the basement, found my OG Xbox, plugged it in, and proceeded to cut the power cable with a box cutter. Yeah. True story.

Despite this, I had an enriching and widely varied childhood, from being a LEGO Star Wars and Bionicle enthusiast, to splitting firewood with my dad, golfing the back 9 at Lake Sunapee, and glueing my eyes to Star Wars: Republic Commando, so I think I turned out okay.

### High School



Noticing my abilities and interests in STEM-related fields, I found it apparent that engineering school would be a good fit. With older brother enrolled in the mechanical engineering program at the University of New Hampshire (UNH), Durham at the time, he recommended that I go there. So, despite being a three-sport varsity athlete, an all-state trumpeter, and a top 15-20% student, I forwent the stressful application process and mailed in my fee-waived application to UNH.

### College

#### Freshman Year

##### Responsible Things

Having an older brother that shares your interests makes life a lot easier, as you are basically living his life -- version 2.0. I got to campus early, due to my brother's recommendation to get a work-study job in the library. He also recommmended that I get familiar with a professor as soon as I could to act as a mentor. My brother did research with Dr. Ivaylo Nedylakov to simulate cavitation events induced by hydrofoils in a water tunnel using OpenFOAM, a FOSS computational fluid dynamics simulation library.

Campus is mostly dead at this time, before the freshman influx, and a good opportunity to get lunch with a professor. And so I did, and this led to me volunteering for a senior capstone project tasked with restoring the High-speed Cavitation Tunnel (HiCaT) located in the Chase Ocean Engineering Laboratory, i.e. manual labor. However, this got me close to senior engineering students, and showed me a version of what I could do when I'm a senior. 

I'll summarize my courses based on code:

- CHEM 405: Chemical Principles for Engineers
    
    The most noteworthy thing about this course was that it had online homework similar to Mastering [insert STEM subject], which I did not appreciate, as I consider this a cop-out by the professor instead of developing a curriculum on their own.

- MATH 426: Calculus II
    
    Probably the course that challenged the most early one, and the one that I tried most on. I have particularly bad memories of trig substitution for odd integrals, as that's a rare application of brute-force memorization in engineering school.

- ME 441: Intro to Engineering Design and Solid Modeling

    I did really bad in this course. It felt like there weren't many opportunities to ask Prof. Kinsey to stop and explain something, rather you had to listen occasionally and review slides. I will say that I took this class before I felt totally comfortable in my studying routine. The final project for this class was to build a bridge made of letter paper, which I tanked along with Jon Ells. We had a third partner who did literally nothing, and I think Jon and I haphazardly threw together rolled pages together into a bridge. 

    Meanwhile Ari Schmidt has this wire-thin contraption that blew everyone's bridge out of the water with regards to load-to-weight ratio.

- EREC 411: Environmental and Resource Economics

    Hands down the most boring course I have ever taken in my life. This was an 8am course held in the theatre rooms of the MUB, which is a perfect recipe for mindless online shopping, reddit browsing, and catching z's.

- PHYS 407: General Physics

    My favorite course all freshman year, and one of the top experiences I've had at UNH. Dr. David Mattingly the GOAT, and our TAs for lab were really good as well. Mattingly would have these bonus questions that people got motivated by; everyone would gather on the second floor of DeMerritt outside of his office, where there's a huge blackboard wall. I rememeber spending afternoons up there discussing our thoughts with each other, and begging Mattingly for crumbs to help solve the problem.

<!-- ##### Irresponsible Things

While college is where a young man enriches himself with intellectual pursuits, it is also where boys become men, and that is rarely ever a quiet process. 

Although this time would not my first encounter with alcohol, as I would chug my grandparents' wine before mowing their lawn during the summer, it would be my first exposure to liquor and getting shitfaced. -->

#### Sophomore Year

#### Junior Year

#### Senior Year

I graduated from the University of New Hampshire, Durham with a Bachelor's of Science in Mechanical Engineering, having focused on thermo-fluids and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). 

## Professionally

I am a 25 year-old mechanical engineering graduate attempting to expand my software engineering abilities while simultaneously improving my Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) skills. Having recently started a position at a CAE software company, these subjects were not picked randomly. Ultimately, I would like my career to focus in either the semiconductor or renewable energy fields, where I can apply my CFD knowledge and experience.

However, much of my experience at work has guided me towards IT, cloud, and HPC interests.

To supplement my self-learning, I plan to enroll in a graduate program to earn my MS, and perhaps consider PhD studies if things turn out that way.

> Despite my acceptance into Dartmouth's MEng program to study thermo-fluids and high-performance computing, the cost of admission is too steep for me to justify the additional workload.

In my younger days, I was a huge gamer, having logged thousands of hours into the Battlefield series, NBA 2K, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Destiny 1 and 2, and various other games. As greater responsiblities arise, gaming becomes more of a winding-down or social activity, rather than something to dedicate focused time and attention to, however I enjoy the following titles:

- Shooter
  - Competitive
    - Counter Strike (Source onward)
    - The Finals
    - PUBG
  - Looter
    - Borderlands 2 (still need to play 1, TPS, 3)
    - Destiny 2 (dead game)
    - Escape From Tarkov (TBD)
  - Military
    - Battlebit Remastered
    - Battlefield (any)
    - COD (not that much tho)
  - Tactical
    - Ghost Recon (not that tactical but)
    - Hitman (TBD)
    - Metal Gear Solid (TBD)
    - Ready Or Not (TBD)
  - Deep Rock Galactic
- Factory
  - Factorio

- RPG
  - Assassin's Creed (any) (i know i know ubisoft isnt great)
  - Cyberpunk 2077 (objectively a good game)
  - Far Cry (older ones)
- Survival
  - The Forest
  - Raft
  - Rust

Nowadays my free time is dedicated more towards fitness and self-improvement. I recently bought a 2021 Scott Addict 10 Disc and subscribed to [TrainerRoad](https://www.trainerroad.com/) to build my FTP and hopefully start chasing Strava KOMs. My real reason for doing this is to build an endurance fitness foundation to cycle in national parks, which typically have tough climbs. I was an all-state 400m runner in high school, but my long distance performance is pitiful, and I would like to improve my fitness.

Ideologically and philosophically, I try to keep an open mind to the infinitude of idaas out there, while simultaneously taking them with a grain of salt. This combination has labeled me as a conservative, a liberal, a centrist, and everything in between. I agree with principles presented in communism, liberalism, anarchism, and many other ideologies. In general, I try to avoid strict ideology and use my personal experience as a basis instead. 

I prefer the realm of hard sciences to soft sciences, which is why I'm an engineer, but observing the polarized discourse of soft sciences like sociology, economics, politics and such frustrates me, and I wish I could do something about it. If I could, I would just be another voice in the reactionary Twitterverse so I just opt out of that. It is apparent to me that the primary issues humanity faces belong to the soft sciences, as our technology enables us to provide plenty at home and bring us to the stars.
