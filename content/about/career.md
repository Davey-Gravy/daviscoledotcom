I am a 25 year-old mechanical engineering graduate attempting to expand my software engineering abilities while simultaneously improving my Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) skills. Having recently started a position at a CAE software company, these subjects were not picked randomly. Ultimately, I would like my career to focus in either the semiconductor or renewable energy fields, where I can apply my CFD knowledge and experience.

However, much of my experience at work has guided me towards IT, cloud, and HPC interests.

To supplement my self-learning, I plan to enroll in a graduate program to earn my MS, and perhaps consider PhD studies if things turn out that way.
