In leisure, I don't think I'm too different from most my age. I enjoy following and participating in all manner of sports, especially basketball, cycling, and soccer. I'm an avid music fan of all genres, though most especially EDM, hip-hop (rap + R&B), and hyperpop/punk.

## Gaming

In my younger days, I was a huge gamer, having logged thousands of hours into the Battlefield series, NBA 2K, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Destiny 1 and 2, and various other games. As greater responsiblities arise, gaming becomes more of a winding-down or social activity, rather than something to dedicate focused time and attention to, however I enjoy the following titles:

- Shooter
  - Competitive
    - Counter Strike (Source onward)
    - The Finals
    - PUBG
  - Looter
    - Borderlands 2 (still need to play 1, TPS, 3)
    - Destiny 2 (dead game)
    - Escape From Tarkov (TBD)
  - Military
    - Battlebit Remastered
    - Battlefield (any)
    - COD (not that much tho)
  - Tactical
    - Ghost Recon (not that tactical but)
    - Hitman (TBD)
    - Metal Gear Solid (TBD)
    - Ready Or Not (TBD)
  - Deep Rock Galactic
- Factory
  - Factorio
  - Satisfactory
- RPG
  - Assassin's Creed (any) (i know i know ubisoft isnt great)
  - Cyberpunk 2077 (objectively a good game)
  - Far Cry (older ones)
- Survival
  - The Forest
  - Raft
  - Rust

## Fitness

Nowadays my free time is dedicated more towards fitness and self-improvement. I recently bought a 2021 Scott Addict 10 Disc and subscribed to [TrainerRoad](https://www.trainerroad.com/) to build my FTP and hopefully start chasing Strava KOMs. My real reason for doing this is to build an endurance fitness foundation to cycle in national parks, which typically have tough climbs. I was an all-state 400m runner in high school, but my long distance performance is pitiful, and I would like to improve my fitness.

## Philosophy

Ideologically and philosophically, I try to keep an open mind to the infinitude of idaas out there, while simultaneously taking them with a grain of salt. This combination has labeled me as a conservative, a liberal, a centrist, and everything in between. I agree with principles presented in communism, liberalism, anarchism, and many other ideologies. In general, I try to avoid strict ideology and use my personal experience as a basis instead.

I prefer the realm of hard sciences to soft sciences, which is why I'm an engineer, but observing the polarized discourse of soft sciences like sociology, economics, politics and such frustrates me, and I wish I could do something about it. If I could, I would just be another voice in the reactionary Twitterverse so I just opt out of that. It is apparent to me that the primary issues humanity faces belong to the soft sciences, as our technology enables us to provide plenty at home and bring us to the stars.
