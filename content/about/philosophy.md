I will attempt to describe my *modus operandi*, my driving philosophy, my reason to keep going.

I have always considered myself a *do-er*, someone who likes *doing* things. I like to evaluate myself and my progress by seeing what I am able to do now, as compared to the past. This can have different time scales; yesterday, last week, last month, last year, last decade.

I've had some talks with my brother about this in relation to work and our careers, and how I really put my nose to the grindstone professionally and personally. He has said to me verbatim, "You seem to value *doing* things more than me".

My immediate thought to this is, what is a human, if they are not doing? If one is not actively applying themselves to a particular task, then they may be in idle thought. I consider this doing. I love to sit in idle thought in slower moments of my life. I almost always complete these idle thought sessions with something of value, whether it was an internal understanding I have reached, newly found motivation to do something, or, if I'm lucky, a good idea.

I have wondered if this is an ego thing of mine; that I am chasing satisfaction purely from making my mark on the world, regardless of the outcome of my meddling. I would like to think that I put a lot of thought into the things I care about, and that I should hold these positions strongly due to the thought and consideration put into the given topic.

I like to *do* because it doesn't limit me to a single area. While most of my daylight hours are spent working in software engineering, I take small breaks to practice music, whether on guitar, trumpet, or a computer. I work on my car, since the bills will pile up if I bring it to the shop for every minor maintenance job.

I've just spent a lot of time thinking about life. How will I stay financially stable? Where can I save money? How do I avoid burnout? How do I keep myself happy?

The things I do are coping mechanisms for my life.
