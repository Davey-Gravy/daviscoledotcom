Ultimately this show is about Frieren herself and her relationship with time.

While the show presents itself as Frieren observing her own behavior and relationships - comparing her experience with hero’s party with the current journey with Fern and Stark - I can imagine this represents the cyclical nature of life. 
Early in the show, Fern and other characters go out of their way to critique Frieren’s less desirable qualities, which stem from her extended perspective on life.
However, we see that she is exposed to some of those critiques in the flashbacks to the hero’s party.
While she has the intellectual capacity to understand the lessons in those moments, Frieren is stubborn.

We the audience are very similar in that regard.
We know what we should be doing to achieve whatever we desire, but we don’t take the best practices and advice to heart.

However, we feel that this time around is different.
Frieren devotes herself to understanding humans better.
Her relationships with those close to her are improving.
Being stubborn doesn’t mean you can’t change.

I found myself relating to Frieren quite often.
I’m more detached than I should be.
I have a superiority complex.
I feel like I’m surrounded by children.
I have regrets.

This show was one of the easiest watches I’ve had in a long time.
I wasn’t overwhelmed with tired anime tropes.
The characters were enjoyable didn’t annoy me at any time.
The pacing of the show is very steady once Fern grows up.
Absolutely no filler at all.

You feel like you’ve tagged along with a Legend of Zelda adventure.
These past few days I've found it difficult to play video games, but today I watched 6 epsiodes in a row to finish season 1.
I consider that a ringing endorsement.
