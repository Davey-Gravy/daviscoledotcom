## Impression

I listened to this on audiobook, and Dan's reading was honestly compelling.
His journalism degree and news anchor voice are on full display, complete with fun and obscure vocabulary choices.

I remember putting it on for my drive from Worcester back home and just soaking it in.
I was locked in basically the full 2.5 hrs.

I come away more curious about meditation and the benefits focused practice can bring.

I haven't actively practiced it yet because I have the notion that I live a meditative life.
Especially now in the world of smartphones, I make concerted efforts to pay attention to my internal and external perception and phenonemna.
Admittedly, my patience would benefit from deliberate practice, doing breathwork for 15 to 30 minutes.

Dan is incredibly candid in sharing his problems, ranging from drug addiction to panic attacks.
It reminded me that success often has a price.
