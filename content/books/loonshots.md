I believe I bought this book at Powell's Books in Portland, Oregon while on a post-graduation west coast road trip with my guys.

At this point in my life, I didn't have much sense for running a business.
I was familiar with managing college group projects, which has some loose connection to working in the real world.
I suppose would be the first "Personal MBA"-type book I've read.

I was unusually hooked by this book as well. I had a particular intererst in maintaining the balance between fast-paced R&D shops and hulking corporate dinosaurs.
