Man, I feel bad for not wanting to finish this book in one go.
As an engineer you want to appreciate and support this kind of media, but man it can be quite dry.

Pure plot progression can work, but the journal entries feel nearly identical once you get a year into his journey or so.

Maybe I need to watch the movie to inspire me.
Love me some Matt Damon.
