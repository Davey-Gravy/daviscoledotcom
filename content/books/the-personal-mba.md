This is basically an index of mental models that covers business:

- marketing and sales
- finance and accounting
- product development

It's intended to be something that you leave on your desk, pick up, and just browse for what you're interested in.
I read two or three sections of this before giving up, but I enjoyed Kaufman's writing style and ability to describe his mental models.
