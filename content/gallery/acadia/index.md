A wonderful trip to Acadia in the dog days of 2020.

Shoutout Narrows Too.

During this trip, we got stuck in a heavy thunderstorm, and our Jeep's rear-view mirror started leaking water.

This also was the only time True American was executed properly.

We also got stuck listening to Channel Orange for the entire 4-day stay.
