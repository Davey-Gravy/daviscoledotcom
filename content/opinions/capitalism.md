I think capitalism is working if you make one assumption; that we're living in hell.

I believe that capitalism is the best way to tap into a person's motivation and drive innovation.

*Innovation*. I'm starting to sound like a FAANG PM. Unfortunately, capitalism's biggest winners don't seem to embody capitalism, but socialism.

People question the success of companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, etc., that they were backed by certain powers that be who want to advance an agenda.
