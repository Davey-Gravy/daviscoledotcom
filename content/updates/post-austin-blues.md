Man, am I bad at making these updates. Ideally I would have written or typed something up immediately after 6 days in Austin, but that's how bad my discipline can be.

I suppose I'll just go order of events:

1. Day before the flight Matt and I register for a Founders Running Club 5k at 8:00 am on Luma
2. We proceed to get 2 hours of sleep in Austin and debate not going
3. Spirits were raised the moment we arrive
4. 5k is run and the club chops it up at Afuga
5. We proceed to set up TopGolf, hiking, climbing, and pickleball with new friends within an hour, all the while discusssing startups, real estate, the market, technology, healthcare, *sheeeeesh*
6. Just about everyone we met and every activity we did was very fun, had hardly any unhappy moments

I have been neglecting myself these past 2 years. I have been shielding myself from living in the real world.

Sometimes I wonder if my experience in Iceland had set myself up for self-isolation in the Northeast.

Honestly, I know I did. I told myself after Iceland that I was tired of moving home base, and that I wanted live in the same property for more than a year. I seem to have fulfilled that desire.

Now that I finally left home and tried to meet new people, I find that there are people that I can share ideas and work with. This is something that I thought I could do where I grew up, but things felt very different down there. It was warmer both climatically and socially.

I met people who had real drive -- working multiple jobs, managing multiple properties, launching multiple startups -- which is something that I haven't found back home.

I had such a great time that I am certainly returning, and for a longer stay. I never was able to get into the rhythm of working, save for some moments at epoch.

I want to feel how daily life is in Austin, as well as Cedar Point, Pflugerville, Manor, etc. It seems even more car dependent than the Northeast, which is a shame, but I'm curious how the rapid transit works.

What I'm upset about is that I was so active and adult while in Austin. I was doing all the housework from cooking to cleaning, we did a lot of physical activity, we attend real events where I felt like I learned t hings, all great stuff.

The only time I really feel like that here is when I go to Baker Library, which I often need Gaby to encourage me to do.

The one habit that I return while I'm settled here is the gym, which is very good.
