I find myself getting into funks really often now.
I have a feeling it’s because I’m dealing with mounting career responsibilities in parallel with personal issues, including my health and my relationships.

I am not incapable of doing work during these times, but it severely limits how deep I can allow myself to go.
I can always allow myself to grind myself to the bone, but I have been doing this for the past 3-4 years.
I am trying to tell myself it’s okay to not grind myself to the bone, but I’m starting a PhD program in two months.
My impression is that I will have to apply myself moreso than I have while at work, which I see as an existential threat; I will have to drive to campus; I will have to sit in lecture; I will have to sit to study.
All of these are terrible for my back.

For the first time in my life, I don't feel comfortable in my own body.
I don't feel comfortable doing the things I love.

I don’t know if I’m supposed to be taking things more easily than I should be.
I don’t know if I should be away from my family and hometown right now. 
I find myself not knowing things, when I typically am so sure of myself.

It’s during these times that I turn inward to media, usually anime.

I try to play video games first, but I pull up my Steam library and flounder with listlessness and indecision.
Perhaps I boot up Cyberpunk 2077 for 15 minutes, wonder what the fuck I’m doing, then Alt–F4.

To justify my behavior, I’d suggest that anime is more efficient in world building and character development compared to singleplayer video games, which feels like I’m robbing myself of enjoyment.
I’m not allowing myself to waste a bit of time and immerse myself into a world.
This is where Breath of the Wild was very different.
It was such a compelling and beautiful world that I couldn’t ignore it, I had to experience what it had to offer.
It’s been a very long time since I’ve felt that from a video game.

Cyberpunk feels too dry.
Minecraft is too much of a sandbox.
Rust is too competitive and cutthroat.

It feels like I’m not allowing myself to be happy.
