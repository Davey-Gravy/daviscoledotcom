This summer marks the first time I really feel on my own.

I start my graduate program at WPI in the fall, however I secured an apartment lease in Worcester that started June 1st. Truly living on my own has reminded me of the minutia that most people must consider.

Remembering to lock my doors and bring my keys; learning city trash policies; starting the Massachussetts residency process; taking it easy after hurting my back; it's a level of individual responsibility that I haven't taken on since my semester in Iceland.
Even then, I was fresh out of undergrad, feeling like a college kid, and still living on my parents' dime.

Now I'm the sole guarantor on my rental contract, getting all my groceries, and paying all my bills.

As someone who typically beats the drum of personal responsibility, it's slightly embarrassing that it took this long, but I am learning to put my pride behind me and practice what I preach.

Wearing my proactive optimist hat, I decided to visit Higgins Laboratory to see if anyone was present for the summer.
While Statia (our dept. office administrator) wasn't, Mahdi was up in the lab.
He had to finish his section of a paper that his team is presenting by the end of the week, a survey of machine learning methods in computational fluid dynamics.
I managed to distract him from this high priority task to ask about courses, qualifying exams, and life in Worcester in general.
He provided reassurance about the academics, and that if I'm proactive enough to show up in June, that I shouldn't worry.

Mahdi is great.
I look forward to studying with him.

I have been rather anxious about starting school again.

Reflecting deeper, I have self-imposed an unreasonable amount of pressure on myself.
I have an impression that I have to go above and beyond because the school is paying my tuition and giving me a stipend.
While I've demonstrated myself at work and taken on projects in my spare time, I haven't experienced the rigor of something like graduate fluids courses since Iceland.
Adding to my full-time remote job, I will also be working as a teaching assistant.
While having confidence that I am capable of helping out undergrads, it is another responsibility on my plate.

When I sit back and try removing my overthinking from the picture and focus on my lived experience, I've only had positive indicators. Everyone working with my adviser is friendly has given a solid endorsement. My personal experience with him has reinforced these sentiments.

While this isn't at the top of my concerns causing me stress, it is a concern that causes me stress.
I am doing my best to make a conscious effort to lower my stress, however doing so becomes a test of my patience.
Despite being away from home, I'm still relatively isolated; my body is starting to break down on me; I'm not seeing enough progress at work to feel good about myself; I'm not motivated enough to delve into a deeper personal project.

I know that I need to be kinder to myself and *relax*.

I'm going to be studying at WPI for five years, I need to get myself into a suitable condition to do so.

I give myself excuses why I should feel sorry for myself and wallow, but that does me absolutely no good.
I should be okay with not being 100% and give focus to getting myself as close to 100% as I can.
